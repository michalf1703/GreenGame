# GreenGame

## Description:
GreenGame is an innovative project designed to cultivate ecological awareness among children through an engaging online platform. Developed in Polish, GreenGame offers a variety of interactive features aimed at promoting eco-friendly habits. 
The project was carried out in a group of 13 people.

## Key Features:
1. **Ecological Quizzes:** Users can participate in educational quizzes covering various environmental topics. These quizzes are designed to inform and inspire users to adopt sustainable practices in their daily lives.

2. **Eco-Games:** GreenGame offers a selection of single-player and multiplayer games centered around environmental themes. Through gameplay, users can learn about ecological concepts while having fun. Multiplayer functionality allows users to interact with each other via chat, fostering a sense of community and collaboration.

3. **Achievement System:** Users earn points and badges for their accomplishments within the platform. By completing quizzes, achieving high scores in games, or actively participating in multiplayer activities, users accumulate points that contribute to their overall ranking. This gamified approach incentivizes engagement and encourages users to explore the platform further.

4. **Leaderboards:** GreenGame features a dynamic leaderboard where users can track their progress and compare their achievements with others. The leaderboard enhances competition and motivates users to strive for higher rankings by continuously engaging with the platform and improving their eco-friendly practices.

Overall, GreenGame provides a dynamic and interactive environment where children can learn about environmental conservation in an entertaining and rewarding manner. By combining education with gamification elements, GreenGame aims to inspire a new generation of eco-conscious individuals who are committed to preserving the planet for future generations.

## I was responsible for module: Minigame
#### Description:
The Minigame module within GreenGame offers users the opportunity to engage in an interactive gaming experience focused on environmental conservation. As the developer responsible for this module, my responsibilities included designing and implementing the following features:

1. **Difficulty Levels:** Users can choose from different difficulty levels to tailor the gaming experience to their skill level.

2. **Singleplayer and Multiplayer Modes:** The module supports both singleplayer and multiplayer modes, allowing users to play individually or collaborate with others in real-time.

3. **Gameplay Mechanics:** Within the game, players are tasked with collecting falling trash and depositing it into containers. Successfully collecting trash earns players points, while missing trash results in point deductions. The speed of gameplay varies based on the selected difficulty level.

4. **Multiplayer Communication:** In multiplayer mode, players have the ability to communicate with each other using an integrated chat feature, fostering collaboration and interaction among participants.

Overall, the Minigame module enriches the GreenGame experience by providing users with a fun and educational activity that reinforces the importance of environmental stewardship. My role in developing this module involved conceptualizing, designing, and implementing its various features to ensure an engaging and seamless gameplay experience.
